        <p1>

If you are working out from home (or anywhere but a gym) and<br /> you  have no equipment,
 you are probably struggling to come up <br />with bodyweight exercises that target your back<br />  muscles.
 So, if you  think you need to buy some free weights to <br /> target your back muscles properly, think againâ€¦
 You absolutely<br /> can  target your back muscles and get a great back workout in <br />without  equipment, and even, without a pull bar.
